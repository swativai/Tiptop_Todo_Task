# Todo Manager App

Todo Manager is a simple React application that helps users manage daily tasks. It uses **React Context API** for global state management and **Local Storage** to persist data, so todos remain saved after refreshing the page.

The app supports full **CRUD operations**: users can add,  update, and delete todos, as well as mark them as Pending or Done. Filtering options like All, Today, Pending, and Done make task management easier.

Built with **React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI**, this project demonstrates clean state management and local data persistence without a backend.
